                                    **INTRODUCTION**

                                    The tree identification system that has been built using prolog, identifies trees based on 
                                    their kingdom which is Plantae, and their phylum and the class within the plant taxonomy.

                                    The program has three classes phylums from which trees will be identified from, that is, seedless, non seedless and flowering. Each phylum has trees with different characteristics eg gymnospamae,angiospamae and pteridophyta.

                                    The program asks the user a series of questions from which they will answer yes(y) or no(n).Based on the answers given by the user, the expert system will deduce the type of tree.

                                    **RUNNING THE PROGRAM**
                                    1. cd to the directory of the folder containing the program code.
                                    2. Load the program file.
                                    3. Enter the command run.
                                    4. Interact with the program by writing yes(y) or no(n).
                                    5.After you get your desired result the program will terminate.
